# SAR-Colorization-ISRO
This project focuses on colorizing grayscale Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Deep Learning models trained on paired SAR and Optical data. The goal is to improve SAR data interpretability for geological and environmental applications by predicting natural colors, enhancing visual analysis and insights.
